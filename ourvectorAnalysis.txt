Analysis:
These stats show the statistics for ourvector<T> from my program, where T is the name of my created struct which has a string and a ourvector<char> value inside of it. The amount of ourvector<T> vectors that were created is 2, where both are defined inside of main (data & dnaData). These vectors are then referenced in plenty of functions. These vectors have elements pushed into them in functions "load_db" & "load_dna", where both have elements pushed back into them directly from respective files & then these updated vectors and their elements are referenced/accessed throughout the program in various functions such as "display", "search", etc.
